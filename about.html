					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>
						Toph Beifong is a 12-year-old Earthbender from Gaoling, a city in
						the Earth Kingdom. Born into the wealthy and prestigious Beifong
						family, Toph was expected to live a quiet, sheltered life due to her
						blindness. However, Toph refused to let her lack of sight define her
						and instead found her own unique way to navigate the world.
						Blindness didn’t limit her—it sharpened her connection to her
						surroundings in ways no one else could imagine.
					</p>
					<div class="">
						<p>
							Unlike other Earthbenders, Toph didn’t learn from traditional
							teachers. Instead, she was trained by the original Earthbenders,
							the badgermoles, who are also blind and use seismic vibrations to
							"see." From these majestic creatures, Toph discovered how to use
							her sense of touch to perceive the world around her. By feeling
							the smallest tremors in the ground, she developed a seismic sense
							that allows her to “see” every movement in her environment with
							incredible accuracy.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						Earthbending is an essential part of who Toph is. From mastering
						traditional Earthbending techniques to inventing Metalbending, she
						has pushed the limits of what an Earthbender can achieve. Her
						connection to the earth gives her unmatched strength and precision,
						making her not only a formidable fighter but also deeply attuned to
						the natural world. Toph’s abilities go beyond mere power—they are an
						extension of her resilience and independence.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite the challenges she faced early in life, Toph forged her own
						path and became a symbol of strength and determination. Her story
						isn’t one of limitations but of endless possibilities. Whether she’s
						standing tall in battle, guiding her friends, or proving her worth
						to the world, Toph Beifong embodies the spirit of a true
						Earthbender: grounded, unshakable, and unstoppable.
