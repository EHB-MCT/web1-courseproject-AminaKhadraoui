						<h1>Earthbender</h1>
						<p>
							Toph is a master of Earthbending, using her ability to control the
							earth and rocks around her with incredible precision and power.
							Her unique connection to the ground allows her to sense vibrations
							and manipulate terrain effortlessly.
						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="discover">
						<h1>Discoverer Metalbending</h1>
						<p>
							Toph is credited with discovering Metalbending, a groundbreaking
							technique that allows her to bend metal by sensing its trace
							amounts of earth within, breaking through limits previously
							thought impossible for Earthbenders.
						</p>
						<p>
							Toph Beifong discovered Metalbending during a critical moment when
							she was facing a challenge in her journey. While imprisoned in a
							metal cage by the Fire Nation, she realized that the metal
							surrounding her was not just an unbendable substance but contained
							small traces of earth. By focusing on those vibrations, she was
							able to manipulate the metal for the first time.
						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="sand">
						<h1>Sandbender</h1>
						<p>
							Toph can also bend sand, manipulating it with the same finesse she
							uses for earth. This allows her to control sandstorms and shape
							shifting sand with surprising accuracy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Toph Beifong's sandbending abilities also showcase her artistic
							side, particularly when she uses sand to create intricate and
							beautiful designs. In a creative display of her bending skill, she
							sculpted the city of Ba Sing Se in the sand, demonstrating not
							only her control
						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="agile">
						<h1>Very agile</h1>
						<p>
							LToph's agility is unmatched, enabling her to swiftly move and
							react in any situation. Despite being blind, her heightened senses
							and deep connection to the earth allow her to "see" through
							vibrations, making her aware of her surroundings at all times.
							This ability allows her to move with incredible speed and
							precision, and it doesn't hinder her ability to fight or navigate
							tricky terrain. Her blindness doesn't stop her; instead, it
							enhances her natural agility, turning what would be a disadvantage
							for others into a powerful asset.
						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="sense">
						<h1>Great sense of hearing</h1>
						<p>
							Despite being blind, Toph has an extraordinary sense of hearing,
							allowing her to detect vibrations and “see” the world through
							sound. She can identify voices and never forgets a tone, giving
							her a powerful advantage in combat and strategy.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the search for the thieves that stole appa, Toph encountered
							the man responsible. She immediately recognized his voice, which
							led to her iconic quote: "I never forget a voice."
